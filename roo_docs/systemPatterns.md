# System Architecture Patterns

## Project Structure
- Next.js application
- React-based components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Client-side state management using React hooks

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Component Architecture:
   - Modular calculator components
   - Shared UI components (SliderInput, ResultsCard)
   - Responsive design patterns

2. State Management:
   - Local state with useState hooks
   - Real-time calculation updates
   - Parent-child component communication

3. Styling Approach:
   - Tailwind CSS for utility classes
   - Custom CSS for specific components
   - Inline styles for dynamic values
   - Dark mode theme implementation

4. Responsive Design:
   - Desktop-first approach
   - Container-based layouts
   - Grid system for calculator stages
   - Flexible width constraints

## Architecture Patterns
1. Component Composition:
   - Calculator containers
   - Input components
   - Results display
   - Shared UI elements

2. Event Handling:
   - Input change handlers
   - Real-time calculation updates
   - Responsive layout adjustments

3. Layout Structure:
   - Centered container design
   - Two-column grid for pipeline stages
   - Single-column for time savings
   - Responsive breakpoints
