# ROI Calculator Product Context

## Why this project exists
This project provides an ROI (Return on Investment) calculator tool that helps businesses understand and quantify the potential value of their investments. It includes both a pipeline value calculator and a time savings calculator to give comprehensive insights into different aspects of ROI.

## Problems it solves
1. Helps businesses quantify potential revenue from their sales pipeline
2. Enables calculation of time savings value from process improvements
3. Provides clear visualization of both monthly and annual ROI projections
4. Assists in decision-making by showing impact of different variables (e.g., closing rate, hourly rate)

## How it should work
The calculator offers two main functionalities:

1. Pipeline Value Calculator:
   - Calculates potential revenue based on:
     * Monthly discovery calls
     * Call show rate
     * Qualification rate
     * Client lifetime value
     * Closing rate
   - Shows both pipeline value and final ROI
   - Updates calculations in real-time

2. Time Savings Calculator:
   - Calculates value of time saved based on:
     * Hours saved per week
     * Hourly billing rate
   - Shows monthly and annual projections
   - Updates in real-time

The interface should be responsive, intuitive, and maintain a dark mode aesthetic with consistent styling across all views.
